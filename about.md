Hi! I'm Remy, a researcher in global health focused on infectious disease modeling — especially climate-sensitive diseases like dengue and malaria. My work bridges statistics, epidemiology, and policy-relevant insights.

This site is where I share reflections, tutorials, and resources related to modeling, data science, and global health.

Thanks for stopping by! 🌍
